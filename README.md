##About Me
Hi my name is Jay and I am currently working as a Trade Surveilance Risk Analyst in the fixed income space. 
I am very interested in analyzing macroeconomic data and wanted to use this as a portfolio to practice and demonstrate my analytical capabilities using mostly Python and publicly available data.
