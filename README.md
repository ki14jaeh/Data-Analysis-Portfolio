# Inflation and US Economy Outlook
## Rising Oil Prices
Crude oil prices are beginning to upside as two of the largest crude exporters, China and Russia, prolongs their voluntary production cut[^1]. The existing fear of inflation makes the inflationary pressure of rising oil prices particulary pulpable. With the 2024 Presidential Election on the horizon, rising gas prices are critical for President Biden's re-election campaign. Last year, Biden has already utilized 180 mm barrels of the US Petroleum Reserve, which is now at the lowest level since 1983[^2]. The fund has declined by approximately 300 mm barrels since Biden took office[^3].
