# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
Hi my name is Jay and I am currently working as a Trade Surveilance Risk Analyst in the fixed income space. 
I am very interested in macroeconomic data analytics and wanted to use this as a portfolio to practice and demonstrate my analytical capabilities mostly using Python, R, and Excel.
